  abstract = {The surging needs for the Internet of Things (IoT) are dramatically shifting the network structure and
    challenging the traditional perimeter security paradigm. To establish secure and trustworthy interoperability
    among billions of heterogeneous interconnected devices, there is a need for standards defining a common framework.
    In this standard, a blockchain-based Zero-Trust access control framework is defined. The framework provides a
    typical implementation model and deployment variations, addressing general security and trust in IoT applications
    with the inspiration of the emerging Zero-Trust paradigm and blockchain technology. The leverage of blockchain and
    Zero-Trust discussed could provide reliable interactions among people, things, and applications in the presence of
    failures and attacks, and improve an IoT system’s overall information technology security posture.},

  abstract = {Lov K. Grover’s 1996 STOC paper introduces a quantum search algorithm that locates a single
    “marked” item in an unstructured database of size N using O(√N) oracle queries, versus Θ(N) classically.
    The algorithm prepares a uniform superposition over N indices and iterates two unitary steps: a phase flip of the
    marked state(s) via an oracle and an inversion about the mean (the diffusion operator). Each Grover iteration
    coherently amplifies the marked amplitude, producing a rotation in a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the
    marked state and the average of unmarked states. After approximately (π/4)√N iterations, measuring the register
    returns the solution with high probability. The paper proves the query complexity is within a constant factor of
    optimal for this problem and sketches extensions to multiple matches, where about O(√(N/M)) iterations suffice
    when M items are marked. Conceptually, the speedup arises from constructive and destructive interference shaped by
    simple reflections, not massive parallelism alone. Although idealized—assuming a black-box oracle and noiseless
    unitaries—the result established a canonical limit for unstructured search and seeded a broad family of
    amplitude-amplification techniques used across quantum algorithms. Grover’s construction remains a cornerstone
    example demonstrating provable quadratic advantage under minimal structure assumptions, complementing Shor’s
    exponential-speedup results for factoring.},

  abstract = {The work titled "Attention Is All You Need" introduces a novel neural network architecture known as the
    Transformer, which is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks in natural language processing. The authors, Vaswani
    et al., propose a model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eschewing the recurrent and
    convolutional layers commonly used in previous architectures. This approach allows for greater parallelization
    during training and improves the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies in data. The Transformer
    architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple layers that utilize self-attention
    and feed-forward neural networks. The authors detail the multi-head attention mechanism, which enables the model
    to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, enhancing its contextual understanding.
    Additionally, they introduce positional encoding to retain the sequential information of the input data. The paper
    presents extensive experiments on translation tasks, demonstrating that the Transformer outperforms existing
    models in terms of both accuracy and training efficiency. The authors conclude that the self-attention mechanism
    is a powerful alternative to traditional methods, paving the way for future research and applications in various
    domains of machine learning and natural language processing.},

    (Einstein–Rosen bridges) are two descriptions of the same underlying relation—“ER=EPR.” Starting from the
    thermofield-double picture of two maximally entangled black holes, they show that the classical geometry contains
    an ER bridge linking the horizons, yet remains non-traversable, so no superluminal signaling occurs. They then
    recast the AMPS firewall paradox in this setting: operations that distill or manipulate Hawking-partner quanta
    outside one hole correspond to dramatic, but still causally consistent, changes behind the other hole’s horizon.
    In this view, apparent paradoxes stem from trying to ascribe simultaneous, incompatible descriptions to entangled
    subsystems. The paper illustrates how interior experience for an infaller can remain smooth while exterior
    observers perform complicated, computationally hard manipulations on the entangled partner, and it frames
    black-hole interiors as state-dependent constructs tied to patterns of entanglement. Broadly, ER=EPR suggests
    spacetime connectivity is a manifestation of entanglement structure, linking quantum information to geometry and
    offering a route to resolve firewall-type tensions without violating causality.},

  abstract = {Microservice systems are often deployed in complex cloud-based environments and may involve a large
    number of service instances being dynamically created and destroyed. It is thus essential to ensure observability
    to understand these microservice systems’ behaviors and troubleshoot their problems. As an important means to
    achieve the observability, distributed tracing and analysis is known to be challenging. While many companies have
    started implementing distributed tracing and analysis for microservice systems, it is not clear whether existing
    approaches fulfill the required observability. In this article, we present our industrial survey on microservice
    tracing and analysis through interviewing developers and operation engineers of microservice systems from ten
    companies. Our survey results offer a number of findings. For example, large microservice systems commonly adopt a
    tracing and analysis pipeline, and the implementations of the pipeline in different companies reflect different
    tradeoffs among a variety of concerns. Visualization and statistic-based metrics are the most common means for
    trace analysis, while more advanced analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining are seldom used.
    Microservice tracing and analysis is a new big data problem for software engineering, and its practices breed new
    challenges and opportunities.},

  abstract = {Bernhard Ömer’s “Quantum Programming in QCL” introduces QCL, an imperative, C-like language that
    unifies classical control flow with quantum operations to make algorithm design and simulation practical on
    conventional hardware. The work motivates programming-language abstractions for quantum computing—data types,
    procedures, scope, and memory management—so programmers can express high-level intent while the interpreter
    handles reversible quantum semantics under the hood. Core constructs include quantum registers (qureg) and two
    operator kinds: general unitary operators and reversible pseudo-classical qufuncts. QCL supports automatic inverse
    execution, Bennett-style scratch-space management, local quantum variables via a “quheap,” conditional
    application of quantum operators, and convenient register slicing/concatenation. Paired with a C++ simulator
    (libqc), QCL exposes introspection and debugging aids (e.g., dump) that reveal machine state during
    simulation—useful for pedagogy and verification despite quantum states being unobservable in hardware. The
    thesis demonstrates end-to-end algorithm construction—combining classical scaffolding with quantum kernels—and
    provides syntax references and worked examples (e.g., modular arithmetic and Shor’s factoring routine) to
    illustrate design patterns for reversible subroutines, ancilla reuse, and clean uncomputation. Overall, the
    document frames quantum programming as disciplined software engineering, showing how familiar procedural
    techniques can systematically bridge abstract Hilbert-space math and concrete gate-level implementations},

  abstract = {Bernhard Ömer’s dissertation “Structured Quantum Programming” develops a disciplined,
    software-engineering approach to quantum algorithms. It argues that the same abstractions that tamed classical
    complexity—types, hierarchical procedures, memory management, and structured control—can and should organize
    quantum programs. The work centers on QCL, a C-like imperative language that integrates classical control with
    quantum kernels. QCL provides explicit quantum data types (qubit registers) with access modes, two operator
    families—general unitary operators and reversible pseudo-classical functions—and facilities for automatic
    inverse execution and Bennett-style scratch-space management to ensure clean uncomputation. It introduces local
    quantum variables via a managed “quheap,” convenient register slicing/concatenation, and conditional operator
    application, allowing programmers to assemble complex routines while preserving reversibility constraints. The
    thesis emphasizes hybrid execution, where classical scaffolding orchestrates quantum subroutines, and demonstrates
    patterns for ancilla reuse, measurement-aware control flow, and stepwise refinement from high-level intent to
    gate-level realization. Paired tooling (an interpreter/simulator) supports inspection and debugging during
    simulation, aiding pedagogy and verification even though real quantum states cannot be observed. Overall, Ömer
    shows that principled programming constructs make quantum development more practical and maintainable, framing
    quantum software as an extension of established structured programming rather than an ad hoc collection of

  abstract = {The work titled "Quantum Gravity in the 21st Century" by Steven Carlip discusses the challenges and
    developments in the field of quantum gravity, which seeks to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics.
    Carlip explores various approaches to quantum gravity, including string theory, loop quantum gravity, and causal
    set theory, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. The author emphasizes the importance of
    understanding the fundamental nature of spacetime and the role of quantum fluctuations in shaping the universe at
    its most fundamental level. Carlip also addresses the implications of quantum gravity for cosmology, particularly
    in relation to the early universe and black hole physics. He discusses how quantum effects may influence the
    behavior of black holes and the potential for a quantum description of the Big Bang. The paper reflects on the
    philosophical implications of these theories, questioning the nature of reality and the limits of human
    understanding. Carlip concludes by advocating for continued interdisciplinary collaboration and experimentation in
    the pursuit of a coherent theory of quantum gravity, suggesting that breakthroughs may arise from unexpected
    directions. This work serves as a comprehensive overview of the state of quantum gravity research at the turn of
    the 21st century, providing insights into ongoing debates and future directions in the field.},

    platforms on the political uprisings that occurred in the Arab world during the early 2010s. The authors analyze
    how social media facilitated communication and organization among activists, enabling them to mobilize support and
    disseminate information rapidly. The study highlights the dual nature of social media as both a tool for
    empowerment and a means for government surveillance and repression. By exploring case studies from various
    countries, the authors illustrate the diverse ways in which social media was utilized, from coordinating protests
    to sharing real-time updates and garnering international attention. The research also discusses the limitations of
    social media, including the digital divide and the potential for misinformation. Ultimately, the work contributes
    to the understanding of the complex relationship between technology and social movements, suggesting that while
    social media played a significant role in the Arab Spring, it was not the sole factor driving the uprisings. The
    authors call for further research into the long-term effects of social media on political engagement and activism
    in the region. This study is relevant for scholars interested in media studies, political science, and Middle

    programming in the context of software development. The paper emphasizes the advantages of functional programming
    paradigms, particularly in enhancing code clarity, maintainability, and correctness. Hughes illustrates how
    functional programming promotes a declarative style of coding, which allows developers to express the logic of
    computation without detailing control flow. This abstraction leads to more concise and understandable code,
    reducing the likelihood of errors. Hughes discusses key concepts such as higher-order functions, lazy evaluation,
    and recursion, demonstrating how these features enable programmers to construct complex operations from simpler
    ones. He also highlights the role of functional programming in facilitating reasoning about programs, as functions
    can be treated as first-class citizens, allowing for more modular and reusable code. The paper concludes by
    advocating for the adoption of functional programming techniques in mainstream programming practices, suggesting
    that they can lead to more robust software systems. Overall, Hughes presents a compelling case for the relevance

  abstract = {Alan Turing, pioneer of computing and WWII codebreaker, is one of the most important and influential
    thinkers of the twentieth century. In this volume for the first time his key writings are made available to a
    broad, non-specialist readership. They make fascinating reading both in their own right and for their historic
    significance: contemporary computational theory, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life
    all spring from this ground-breaking work, which is also rich in philosophical and logical insight. An
    introduction by leading Turing expert Jack Copeland provides the background and guides the reader through the
    selection. About Alan Turing Alan Turing FRS OBE, (1912-1954) studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge. He
    was elected a Fellow of King's in March 1935, at the age of only 22. In the same year he invented the abstract
    computing machines - now known simply as Turing machines - on which all subsequent stored-program digital
    computers are modelled. During 1936-1938 Turing continued his studies, now at Princeton University. He completed a
    PhD in mathematical logic, analysing the notion of 'intuition' in mathematics and introducing the idea of oracular
    computation, now fundamental in mathematical recursion theory. An 'oracle' is an abstract device able to solve
    mathematical problems too difficult for the universal Turing machine. In the summer of 1938 Turing returned to his
    Fellowship at King's. When WWII started in 1939 he joined the wartime headquarters of the Government Code and
    Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire. Building on earlier work by Polish cryptanalysts, Turing
    contributed crucially to the design of electro-mechanical machines ('bombes') used to decipher Enigma, the code by
    means of which the German armed forces sought to protect their radio communications. Turing's work on the version
    of Enigma used by the German navy was vital to the battle for supremacy in the North Atlantic. He also contributed
    to the attack on the cyphers known as 'Fish'. Based on binary teleprinter code, Fish was used during the latter
    part of the war in preference to morse-based Enigma for the encryption of high-level signals, for example messages
    from Hitler and other members of the German High Command. It is estimated that the work of GC&CS shortened the war
    in Europe by at least two years. Turing received the Order of the British Empire for the part he played. In 1945,
    the war over, Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London, his brief to design and
    develop an electronic computer - a concrete form of the universal Turing machine. Turing's report setting out his
    design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) was the first relatively complete specification of an electronic
    stored-program general-purpose digital computer. Delays beyond Turing's control resulted in NPL's losing the race
    to build the world's first working electronic stored-program digital computer - an honour that went to the Royal
    Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University, in June 1948. Discouraged by the delays at NPL,
    Turing took up the Deputy Directorship of the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory in that year. Turing was
    a founding father of modern cognitive science and a leading early exponent of the hypothesis that the human brain

  abstract = {"The Fractal Geometry of Nature" by Benoit B. Mandelbrot is a seminal work that introduces the concept
    of fractals and their relevance in understanding complex natural phenomena. Mandelbrot, a mathematician known for
    his pioneering contributions to the field of fractal geometry, explores how fractals can describe irregular shapes
    and patterns found in nature, such as coastlines, clouds, and mountains. The book emphasizes the idea that
    traditional Euclidean geometry is often inadequate for modeling the complexity of natural forms. Mandelbrot
    presents a range of mathematical concepts and visual representations to illustrate how fractals can be generated
    and analyzed. He discusses the implications of fractal geometry in various fields, including physics, biology, and
    economics, highlighting its potential to provide insights into systems characterized by self-similarity and scale
    invariance. The work is notable for its interdisciplinary approach, bridging mathematics with real-world
    applications. Through a combination of theoretical exposition and visual examples, Mandelbrot invites readers to
    reconsider the ways in which they perceive and quantify the natural world. This book has had a profound impact on
    both mathematics and the sciences, influencing subsequent research and inspiring further exploration into the
    complexities of fractal patterns.},

    Crime lords inhabiting lawless corners of the internet have operated more freely—whether in drug dealing, money
    laundering, or human trafficking—than their analog counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By transacting not
    in dollars or pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers, overseen by no government, beholden to no bankers,
    these black marketeers have sought to rob law enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit
    finance: following the money. But what if the centerpiece of this dark economy held a secret, fatal flaw? What if
    their currency wasn’t so cryptic after all? An investigator using the right mixture of technical wizardry,
    financial forensics, and old-fashioned persistence could crack open an entire world of wrongdoing. Tracers in the

    law enforcement and private industry, veteran cybersecurity reporter Andy Greenberg tells an astonishing saga of
    criminal empires built and destroyed. He introduces an IRS agent with a defiant streak; a Bitcoin-tracing Danish
    entrepreneur; and a colorful ensemble of hardboiled agents and prosecutors as they delve deep into the

  abstract = {The paper "End-to-End Arguments in System Design" by Jerome Saltzer, David P. Reed, and David D. Clark
    presents a foundational principle in network and system design known as the end-to-end argument. This principle
    asserts that certain functions in a distributed system should be implemented at the endpoints of a communication
    system rather than at intermediary nodes. The authors argue that placing functionality at the endpoints enhances
    reliability and efficiency, as it allows for more straightforward error handling and application-specific
    processing. The paper discusses various examples, such as error detection and recovery, to illustrate how
    end-to-end design can lead to more robust systems. It critiques the tendency to implement features at lower levels
    of the network stack, which can complicate system design and reduce overall performance. The authors emphasize
    that while there are exceptions where intermediate nodes may perform certain functions, the general guideline
    favors end-to-end implementation for critical services. This work has significantly influenced the design of
    network protocols and distributed systems, promoting a clearer understanding of where to allocate resources and

    conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communication protocols in seven distinct layers.
    The OSI model serves as a guide for designing and troubleshooting network systems, facilitating interoperability
    among diverse communication systems. The seven layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session,
    Presentation, and Application. Each layer has specific functions and protocols, with the Physical layer dealing
    with the transmission of raw data, while the Application layer interfaces directly with end-user applications. The
    article explains the significance of the OSI model in standardizing network communication, which allows different
    systems to communicate effectively. It also highlights how the model aids in diagnosing network issues by
    isolating problems to specific layers. The OSI model is contrasted with the simpler TCP/IP model, which is more
    commonly used in practical applications. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of the OSI model in the
    field of networking, providing a foundational understanding for both professionals and students in the domain of

  abstract = {The "First Draft Report on the EDVAC" by John von Neumann is a foundational document in the history of
    computer science, outlining the architecture and design principles for the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic
    Computer (EDVAC). Written in 1945, the report presents a pioneering concept of a stored-program computer, where
    both data and instructions are stored in the same memory. This innovation marked a significant departure from
    earlier computing machines that required manual reconfiguration for different tasks. Von Neumann details the
    architecture of the EDVAC, including its components such as the arithmetic logic unit, memory, and input/output
    systems. He emphasizes the importance of a binary system for data representation and the use of electronic
    components for speed and efficiency. The report also discusses the implications of this architecture for
    programming and the potential for future developments in computing technology. This document not only serves as a
    technical specification for the EDVAC but also lays the groundwork for subsequent computer designs, influencing
    the development of modern computing systems. Von Neumann's insights into the organization and operation of
    computers have had a lasting impact on the field, establishing principles that continue to underpin computer
    architecture today.},
